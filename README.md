## Using the code example

### Create the project

Create the project and open it using one of the following:

<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox&trade; Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. The **Application(s) Root Path** defaults to the Eclipse workspace which is usually the desired location for the application. If you want to store the application in a different location, you can change the *Application(s) Root Path* value. Applications that share libraries should be in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In command-line interface (CLI)</b></summary>

ModusToolbox&trade; software provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and a command line tool, "project-creator-cli". The CLI tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the "project-creator-cli" tool. On Windows, use the command line "modus-shell" program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; software installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; software tools. You can access it by typing `modus-shell` in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The "project-creator-cli" tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional


<br />

The following example clones the "mtb-example-btstack-threadx-beacon" application with the desired name "ExtAdv Beacon" configured for the *CYW955913EVK-01* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id CYW955913EVK-01 --app-id mtb-example-btstack-threadx-beacon --user-app-name ExtAdv Beacon --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

**Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can invoke the Library Manager GUI tool from the terminal using `make library-manager` command or use the Library Manager CLI tool "library-manager-cli" to change the BSP.

The "library-manager-cli" tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--add-bsp-name` | Name of the BSP that should be added to the application | Required
`--set-active-bsp` | Name of the BSP that should be as active BSP for the application | Required
`--add-bsp-version`| Specify the version of the BSP that should be added to the application if you do not wish to use the latest from manifest | Optional
`--add-bsp-location`| Specify the location of the BSP (local/shared) if you prefer to add the BSP in a shared path | Optional

<br />

Following example adds the CYW955913EVK-01 BSP to the already created application and makes it the active BSP for the app:

   ```
   library-manager-cli --project "C:/mtb_projects/ExtAdv Beacon" --add-bsp-name CYW955913EVK-01 --add-bsp-version "latest-v0.X" --add-bsp-location "local"

   library-manager-cli --project "C:/mtb_projects/ExtAdv Beacon" --set-active-bsp APP_CYW955913EVK-01
   ```

</details>

<details><summary><b>In third-party IDEs</b></summary>

Use one of the following options:

- **Use the standalone [Project Creator](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool:**

   1. Launch Project Creator from the Windows Start menu or from *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/project-creator.exe*.

   2. In the initial **Choose Board Support Package** screen, select the BSP, and click **Next**.

   3. In the **Select Application** screen, select the appropriate IDE from the **Target IDE** drop-down menu.

   4. Click **Create** and follow the instructions printed in the bottom pane to import or open the exported project in the respective IDE.

<br />

- **Use command-line interface (CLI):**

   1. Follow the instructions from the **In command-line interface (CLI)** section to create the application.

   2. Export the application to a supported IDE using the `make <ide>` command.

   3. Follow the instructions displayed in the terminal to create or import the application as an IDE project.

For a list of supported IDEs and more details, see the "Exporting to IDEs" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

## Operation
1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program **.

   </details>

   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain is specified in the application's Makefile but you can override those values manually:
     ```
     make program TARGET=APP_<BSP> TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
     ```

     Example:
     ```
     make program TARGET=APP_CYW955913EVK-01 TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
     ```
   </details>

3. After programming, the application doesn't start automatically. You need to press reset on the EVK board. Observe the beacon using the third-party applications such as the "Beacon Scanner" application. The scanner automatically scans for nearby beacons, and will display the beacons configured in the application, showing Eddystone-URL, iBeacon, and Eddystone-UID as shown here:

   **Figure 3. Beacon scan**

   ![](./images/beacon_scanner_screenshot.jpg)

   **Figure 4. Locate beacon**

   ![](./images/locate_scan.png)


4. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud, and observe application trace messages in the terminal program.

   **Figure 5. Terminal output**

   ![](./images/teraterm_log.png)


## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Attach (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For more details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

**Note:** Debugging is of limited value when there is an active Bluetooth&reg; LE connection because as soon as the Bluetooth&reg; LE device stops responding, the connection will get dropped.


## Design and implementation

The code example configures the device as a AIROC&trade; Bluetooth&reg; LE GAP Peripheral and GATT Server. The example implements Google Eddystone Beacon and Apple iBeacon. After power up, it will continuously advertise beacons. You can use a beacon scanning application to monitor the beacons. The code demonstrates the example usage of extended advertisement functions and uses the Beacon Library functions for Eddystone and iBeacon protocols.

The application uses a UART resource from the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) to print debug messages on a UART terminal emulator.

Upon reset, the application starts automatically and initializes the Bluetooth&reg; stack and other device peripherals. The device starts to advertise its presence as "ExtAdv Beacon" to the peer Central devices. It also advertises Eddystone beacons and iBeacon. Because there are limited slots that can be advertised concurrently, a 1-second timer is used to rotate the advertising beacons.


## Resources and settings

This section explains the ModusToolbox&trade; software resources and their configuration as used in this code example. Note that all the configuration explained in this section has already been done in the code example.

- **Device Configurator:** ModusToolbox&trade; software stores the configuration settings of the application in the *design.modus* file. This file is used by the Device Configurator, which generates the configuration firmware. This firmware is stored in the applicationâ€™s *GeneratedSource* folder.

   By default, all applications in a workspace share the same *design.modus* file - i.e., they share the same pin configuration. Each BSP has a default *design.modus* file in the *mtb_shared\TARGET_<bsp name>\<version>\COMPONENT_BSP_DESIGN_MODUS* directory. It is not recommended to modify the configuration of a standard BSP directly.

   To modify the configuration for a single application or to create a custom BSP, see the [ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide). This example uses the default configuration. See the [Device Configurator guide](https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-ModusToolbox_Device_Configurator_Guide_4-UserManual-v01_00-EN.pdf?fileId=8ac78c8c7d718a49017d99ab297631cb).

- **Bluetooth&reg; Configurator:** The Bluetooth&reg; peripheral has an additional configurator called the "Bluetooth&reg; Configurator" that is used to generate the Bluetooth&reg; LE GATT database and various Bluetooth&reg; settings for the application. These settings are stored in the file named *design.cybt*.

   Note that unlike the Device Configurator, the Bluetooth&reg; Configurator settings and files are local to each respective application. The services and characteristics added are explained in the [Design and implementation](#design-and-implementation) section. See the [Bluetooth&reg; Configurator guide](https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-ModusToolbox_Bluetooth_Configurator_Guide_3-UserManual-v01_00-EN.pdf?fileId=8ac78c8c7d718a49017d99aaf5b231be).
